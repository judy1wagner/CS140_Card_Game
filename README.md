# CS145_Card_Game
Lab 4 of CS140

This is a lab completed in my second of two introduction to programming courses at Whatcom Community College. 

I wrote this a year and a half ago, and I don't have a record of the original prompt. I do remember the basic prompt was to create a card game, and I believe we were learning about Stacks and Queues at that time.

I created 52 card pickup.
